### Background and Context

The agricultural industry is in dire need of modernization due to the extensive manual work required for plant monitoring. Despite advances in technology, sorting and recognizing plants and weeds still demand significant time and effort. Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by greatly reducing the time and energy needed for plant identification through AI and Deep Learning. This has the potential to revolutionize the trillion-dollar agricultural industry, improving crop yields, enabling higher-level decision-making, and fostering sustainable environmental practices in the long run.
